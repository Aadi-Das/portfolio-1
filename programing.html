          <h2>Assignments</h2>

          This class challenging for me especially with javascript. We have had
          assignments. As This is new to me I find that I move slower than my
          peers. And we were tasked with being creative and coming up with our
          own tasks that include javascript as well. For this I had to do quite
          a bit of googling as I just generally don't know ant javascript. So i
          had to make sure i could understand what i was working with.

          <h3>Assignment 1</h3>

          For our first assignment we had to copy a site to the best of our
          ability. This assignment personally was not to bad for me there was
          one part I got stuck on was the separation in the nav bar but I
          managed. This consist of only using html and css so it wasn't too bad

          <h3>Assignment 2</h3>

          For this assignment we had to create multiple HTML pages while only
          using one CSS page. This assignment I found quite challenging and have
          not yet completed. Creating the first page was ok but then the next
          part was quite challenging i was not able to fully complete this
          assignment.

          <h3>Assignment 3</h3>

          For this assignment we had to use json data of our team members
          information and display it. While this initially task was challenging
          I was able to ask Frank who then helped me understand it and quite
          enjoyed it.

          <h3>Assignment 4</h3>

          In this assignment we had to have random images generate on click.
          However the issue with my assignment is that when I click the button
          an image is generated and that same image will be generated each time
          I click the button. But one the page is refreshed a new image will
          appear on click. I haven't been able to get a new image generate on
          each click

          >

          <h3>Assignment 5</h3>

          This assignment was something frank went over step by step and so i
          managed to understand how to create it. I realized that most times for
          this I would make a small syntax error which would prevent it from
          working. For example rob showed me that I was writing scr instead or
          src which prevented my code from working. So i have to pay more
          attention to details. I didn't do any css on it because i wanted to
          make it work.

          <h3>Assignment 6</h3>

          The following assignment used only html and css because I wanted to
          add some animation to my. For this assignment i work with paralex
          scrolling. Honestly this wasn't too hard and was something that i
          believe add to the portfolio. This can be seen in the about me.

          <h3>Assignment 7</h3>

          Initially I created a basic navigation menu but then searched up how I
          can be creative with the navigation menu. So after a lot of googling I
          came across this navigation menu anf thought it would be nice to
          incorporate into my portfolio. I did also have to google why things
          were done a certain was and i changed around to see how it would
          impact the way it looks. This can be seen on my portfolio
          <br /><br /><br />

          <h3>Assignment 8</h3>

          For this assignment I created a 'read more' which had incorporated
          into my learning outcomes page which I no longer use. However I have
          incorporated it into my about me page where I speak on the learning
          outcomes because I thought having all that text always open is not
          necessary. This can be seen in my about me page to the bottom.
          <br />
          I also tried snap scrolling to incorporate into my portfolio.
          <br /><br /><br />

          >

          <h3>Assignment 9</h3>

          I was told to use java 30 for some inspiration of some more javasrcipt
          I can incorporate. I decided to do this because it was one of the
          first tasks of a 30 day challenge so I thought it would be easier for
          me to understand. I choose to do the flex panel gallery, I used a
          different website to help me created it, which I have referenced
          there. I chose this because I thought I could also incorporate this
          into my portfolio bu have figured out where. The website i used was
          pretty clear and this task itself was not too hard to follow.

          >

          <h3>Assignment 10</h3>

          The next task i decided to do was create a clock. I got inspiration
          from java30 for this as well but used which explained each step which
          i also referenced. I will be honest I thought that this would be
          easier that it was because it was the second task of the javascript30.
          I will however say, with the step by step I understand it a lot more
          than I would have if just looked at the code. I am proud of what i
          have come up with
          <br /><br /><br />

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe i achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Interactive media</h3>

          This outcome is something that I am constantly working on. In media
          design the whole point of creating is to have something that is user
          friendly and interactive. This outcome was mostly achieved in out in
          this class where we would have recreate functioning website. The end
          goal of the project as well is to have and interactive website.

          <h3>Development</h3>

          Having smaller goal to achieve the main one is something that i
          constantly do to understand better. For this class I have to do this
          as it helps me understand everything better. I also use git as a
          version control.

          <h3>Professional identity</h3>

          This is something that is a continuing goal. I don't think is
          something you achieve and done. Using javascript is something that i
          have never done but now I am working on that. Getting feed back on the
          assignment as needed.
