          <h2>Assignments</h2>

          I really enjoy UCD class. I however, have to try to take more
          initiative and speak up in class. I especially enjoy this class
          because I enjoy understanding the psychology then behind the choices
          that people make. We have had multiple assignments in this class.
          Below you can see all the assignments done in UCD thus far.

          <h3>Assignment 1</h3>

          Our first UCD assignment was to identify 3 'good' and 3 'bad'
          websites. This was an assignment that put into perspective how the
          look of a website can determine if people will continue on your
          website. It is also easy to point out a bad website but most times
          there is no reaction to a good website. The following link shows the
          website that I found good and bad.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Good and Bad Design</a
          >

          <h3>Assignment 2</h3>

          Our second assignment was was a group assignment where we had to
          create a powerpoint on coca cola's segmentation, targeting &
          positioning. This was research assignment from which I understood who
          coco cola's audience is and how they target their audience. It put
          into perspective the many factors that play a part in a company's
          marketing.

            >CocoCola Research Assignment</a

          <h3>Assignment 3</h3>

          Our next assignment was to find a good example for the corresponding
          principle. This shows how people think and what people want. I
          especially enjoyed this class because it was interesting to learn how
          people behave. And how designers accommodate for these behaviors.

            >UX and Psychology</a
          >

          <h3>Assignment 4</h3>

          For this assignment we had to create an empathy map with our project
          group. We had to do this based on the interview responses we got from
          Erion. The group was split up and we were all working on something
          different for the project. So the following was created by Melany and
          I, then reviewed by the whole group.

            >Empathy Map</a
          >
          <h3>Assignment 5</h3>

          The following assignment was to recreate a website using any
          prototyping tool. I choose to use figma and this is what I came up
          with.

          <h3>Assignment 6</h3>

          For the next assignment in our project group we had to use chat gpt to
          come up with a user scenario based on our research, specifically our
          survey results for our persona. We then had to re-enact our user
          scenario. I decided to work behind the scene and set the camera though
          Tim was the main.

          <h3>Assignment 7</h3>

          The following assignment directly related to the project class. We had
          to create a individual prototype for out client to see. I first
          created a paper prototype of a layout that I thought would match what
          the client would like. Once I liked my paper prototype I created a mid
          fidelity prototype on figma.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Individual prototype</a
          >

          <h3>Assignment 8</h3>

          Linking back to the previous assignment of creating a prototype for
          the client we then had to use heuristic evaluation to evaluate and
          rate how my prototype. This was pretty interesting however I realized
          quite a few of the evaluation points did not apply to my prototype. I
          think it would be interesting to do this to a higher fidelity
          prototype or even evaluate a friend's prototype. Or have someone else
          evaluate and compare how others view can be different from mine.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Heuristic Evaluation</a
          >

          <br /><br />

          The following 4 assignments were part of a bigger long-term assignment
          that were also directly linked to the project. These were done with my
          project group and therefore tasks were split between the group
          members.

          <h3>Assignment 9</h3>

          To better our prototype we had to do usability testing. We went out
          and found 3 school mates to conduct theses tests with. We took our
          highest fidelity figma prototype that was created after getting
          feedback from out client, Erion. We had these testers go through the
          prototype and complete a set of task we had written out. After that we
          asked them for feedback of their experience and their thoughts on the
          website. These tests were conducted by Rob and I, if Rob conducted the
          test I recorded it and vice versa with the other tester. These were
          then transcribed by two other members of the group.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Final Prototype</a
          >

          <h3>Assignment 10</h3>

          We then created 3 storyboards to better understand our users. This
          identifies triggers that will cause a chain reaction of how a user can
          come about to using our client website. Out of the three storyboards I
          created one as can be seen below.
          <br /><br /><br />

          <img src="images/storyboard.png " alt="Storyboard" />

          <h3>Assignment 11</h3>

          We then had to conduct ab testing with specific items on our prototype
          to see the preferences of user. We did this with 10 users the went
          with the majority. The ab testing and its transcription were done by 3
          other group members. With the ab testing we were able to choose
          between specific items and understand what the users may prefer to
          see.

            >A/B test</a
          >

          <h3>Assignment 12 survey</h3>

          For this we had to create a survey for user to to get some final
          answers to some website choices that needed to be made. For this i
          created some question alongside Yvonne and another member created the
          survey in google forms. We share this link into different discord
          servers to get some responses. For out initial survey we also
          conducted short interviews with people the train station but got
          feedback that it would have been better to het a specific type of
          interviewees which would be more beneficial for research.
          <br /><br /><br />

          <br /><br />

          At the end we summarized all this research to better understand our
          users.

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe I achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Interactive Media</h3>

          In this class we worked on understanding our users and what they want
          from you. When creating prototype we created multiple iterations and
          improve on each version. We also had to conduct user research to
          figure out what users want and what reactions to users have to certain
          choices we make. We di usability testing as well as ab testing and
          incorporated that feedback to improve for the next iteration.

          <h3>Design</h3>

          What good design is, is subjective. Through this class I have learned
          how certain choices effect what we want to put out. And how the
          gestalt principles can be used when we make our choices. Users will
          always be able to spot bad design and user tend yo be creatures of
          habit so people have certain notions that we can put to use in our
          design. For example between a red and green button a user will
          automatically associate the red with delete or exit while green with
          complete or success.

          <h3>Research</h3>

          Research is constantly being done to understand users. Research is
          being done to understand users and their needs and wants. Research has
          to be done to stand out after knowing the industry and finding a
          niche. We had to research marketing strategies to understand how to
          entice and manipulate users.

          <h3>End Thoughts</h3>

          As we come to an end of the semester I can say that I have truly
          enjoyed my experience in the ucd classes. I enjoyed understanding how
          users think and how to use that to our benefit. I liked seeing how
          sometimes even small differences can effect how people view something
          as a whole and how much differences these small thing makes.
