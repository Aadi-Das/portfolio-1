          <h2>Photography</h2>

          Here is the photo book that I created for this photography assignment:
          <a href="pdf/PhotoBook_v2.pdf">Photo Book</a>

          This assignment was especially hard for me because I have never taken
          photos on a digital camera. I was previously unfamiliar with all the
          settings on the camera again because I’ve never used a digital camera.
          This assignment required a lot of research for each sub assignment
          that we had. This camera was from ISSD so I can’t say that I have a
          personal connection to the camera but I did find that I could
          understand most of the basic settings after playing around with it.
          <br />
          <br />
          The first task was just to basically understand the camera. Both the
          hardware and some of the basic functionality and what the camera can
          do. After doing this, I realize there are some functions that were
          easier to use than others for example, one that I found myself using
          quite a bit was a program ae because a because most of the settings
          were automatically set by the camera. These were some of the first
          pictures I took:

          <img src="images/initial2.jpeg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/initial3.jpeg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Hidden Faces</h4>

          The next task was hidden faces. So we had to find faces in daily life
          objects or nature that resembled, well a face. Initially, I thought
          that it would be easy because I realized that when I was consciously
          looking for hidden faces I was having a harder time.

          <br />
          <img src="images/face1.jpeg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/face2.jpeg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/face3.jpeg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Waterfall</h4>

          After that is waterfall. So I couldn’t find a waterfall so I tried
          with my shower, but for some reason it wasn’t picking up any of the
          water. I'm still not sure if I didn’t set the camera correctly.
          However, luckily, I ended up finding a water fountain so I decided to
          photograph that with the different shutter speeds. So with a higher
          shutter speed, there is more exposure. So while taking my picture with
          the fountain, I could kind of see the difference. But I understood it
          more when I took pictures of cars in the night. It gave a really cool
          effect with the slow shutter speed while with the faster speed, you
          can only see the headlights of the car, especially because I took
          those photos in the night. I had to use my table to keep it
          steady.Slow to fast shutter speed:

          <br />
          <img src="images/speed1.jpeg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/speed2.jpeg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/speed3.jpeg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Depth of Field</h4>

          The next task had to do with the depth of field. And for this, you had
          to play around with the aperture settings. So the wider the aperture
          is the foreground will be more in focus, while the background will be
          more blurred and out of focus, kind of like portrait mode on iphone.
          While, with a narrow aperture, most of the image will be sharper,
          including the background. I again had to use a table for this.
          Aperture from bigger to smaller. You can especially see this with the
          light in the background getting more in focus

          <br />
          <img src="images/dof1.jpeg" alt="highest ap" />
          <img src="images/dof2.jpeg" alt="med ap" />
          <img src="images/dof3.jpeg" alt="lowest ap" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Noise</h4>

          For this next task, we had to play with the iso setting to see what
          that does in terms of noise or grain for each of the pictures. I could
          see the differences more when I took pictures of my candle in the dim
          room. A higher iso creates more noise or grain, while being brighter,
          even around the candle. The lower ios is darker around the candle, but
          has less grain or noise. So a higher iso can be used when you want to
          make something look more vintage. I had to use my table for this. High
          to low iso.

          <br />
          <img src="images/iso1.jpeg" alt="high iso" />
          <img src="images/iso2.jpeg" alt="low iso" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Picture Composition</h4>

          For picture composition we had to make use of the different
          principles. I took some pictures of contrast. This is when two
          elements are contrasting. My pictures showcase contrast in color.

          <br />
          <img src="images/contrast1.jpeg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/contast2.jpeg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <br />

          The following is symmetry but its not the best. Principle of symmetry
          is when an image mirrors itself. The trees are alined on both sides.
          This image also shows vanishing point as the trees come in closer.

          <br />
          <img src="images/symmetry.jpeg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <br />

          This is an image of frozen movement that I took with a lower adjusted
          shutter speed.

          <br />
          <img src="images/speed1.jpeg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <br />

          <h4>White Balance</h4>

          White balance is a cool assignment to see how colors interact with
          each other and how certain white balance settings can completely
          change the look and the vibe of a photo. For the following environment
          my favorite setting was shade be cause it ket the color while making
          it more vibrant, it almost looks apocalyptic. While tungsten looks
          cold, kind of like how a bad memory is portrayed in movies. Shade(apx.
          7000k) and tungsten(apx. 3200k)

          <br />

          <img src="images/tungsten.jpeg" alt="tungsten" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Portrait</h4>

          The next task was to take a portrait of of a willing subject. I asked
          my friend if she was willing to help and she agreed. For inspiration
          the following image was used
          <br />
          <img src="images/inspo.png" alt="Inspiration" />
          <br />
          <br />
          First I started with some basic picture and tried to be more creative
          as the subject got more comfortable. I tried both a higher and lower
          aperture. I used a medium aperture to get some of the background
          details while keeping the focus on the subject. I also used the
          daylight white balance. The following were my favorite.
          <br />
          <img src="images/portrait1.jpeg" alt="portrait1" />
          <img src="images/portrait2.jpeg" alt="portrait2" />
          <img src="images/portrait3.jpeg" alt="portrait3" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Landscape/Architecture</h4>

          The following task is to take pictures of landscapes and or
          architecture with different focal points. Because I was taking images
          of landscape I used a smaller focal length. This allows me to get a
          larger angle of the landscape. the following three were my favorite:

          <br />
          <img src="images/land.jpeg" alt="landscape" />
          <img src="images/land1.jpeg" alt="landscape" />
          <img src="images/land2.jpeg" alt="landscape" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>Background Compression</h4>

          For this task i used the same person who was the subject of my
          portrait. To do this task I had to walk away from the subject while
          zooming in. The difference in these photos are not great because of
          the lens I used. The background seems to be coming closer while the
          subject remains mostly in the same spot.

          <br />
          <img src="images/back1.jpeg" alt="compression1" />
          <img src="images/back2.jpeg" alt="compression2" />
          <img src="images/back3.jpeg" alt="compression3" />
          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe I achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Interactive media</h3>

          There was a lot of trial and error especially when creating the layout
          of the photo book. Thing were constantly being moved around to
          complement each other. To try to remain creative while not doing too
          much. This was also my first look into indesign

          <h3>Design</h3>

          This learning outcome also come into play while using trying to create
          the photo book layout. Trying to see which font matches what I am
          trying to showcase. How different text and image positioning effects
          how the photo book ends up looking

          <h3>Research</h3>

          This learning outcome can be seen in both the photo book layout as
          well as while taking the photos, mostly while taking the photos. For
          each photography task I had to research which function would create
          the desired output. I had to watch tutorials and I'm still not sure if
          I fully achieved what I wanted to.
