          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe I achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Interactive media</h3>

          There was a lot of trial and error especially when creating the layout
          of the photo book. Thing were constantly being moved around to
          complement eachother. To try to remain creative while not doing too
          much. This was also my first look into indesign

          <h3>Design</h3>

          In this class we had to create a logo and so there have been many
          iterations. I initially used figma then adobe. To have good design it
          is important to have many iterations. With
          <br />
          <br />

          This learning outcome also come into play while using trying to create
          the photo book layout. Trying to see which font matches what I am
          trying to showcase. How different text and image positioning effects
          how the photo book ends up looking

          <h3>Research</h3>

          This learning outcome can be seen in both the photo book layout as
          well as while taking the photos, mostly while taking the photos. For
          each photography task I had to research which function would create
          the desired output. I had to watch tutorials and I'm still not sure if
          I fully achieved what I wanted to.
