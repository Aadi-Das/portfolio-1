          <h2>Assignments</h2>

          For this project I am part of the ZEUS group now consisting of 8
          members including me. This project so far has been going well and
          works well together. We have a new member in our group who I think
          will fit well in the group in my opinion. For this project we have to
          create a website for our client Erion based on his need and wants. The
          following is all what we have done for the project.

          <h3>Team Charter</h3>

          This team charter was initially create by Melany and I to outline the
          group norms, values and roles. It provided a nice visual reminder of
          how we want to interact as a group. We also did this os everyone is
          aware of the group expectations we have.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Team Charter</a
          >

          <h3>Project plan</h3>

          The project plan was our first deliverable. We each worked on
          different aspects of the documents as verifies with the group members
          if we needed help. We did this to put into words what our problem is
          amd how we plan to solve it and create a final deliverable for ort
          client, Erion. Some specific things that was done my me in the project
          plan include: the project definition and background, the risk
          assessment along side Tim, the project structure and the CMD research
          methods and linking it to the corresponding sub-question.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Project Plan</a
          >

          <h3>Mood Board</h3>

          The mood board was created to have a visual representation of Erions
          likes dislikes and his personality. To make this we used the data that
          we got when we conducted the interview with him. This allowed us put
          all of the information that we got from Erion in a concise manner and
          so it is easily understandable.
          <br /><br /><br />

            >Mood Board</a
          >

          <h3>Empathy map</h3>

          We created an empathy map based on the interview responses we got from
          Erion. This helped us to better understand Erion and how he was
          feeling and what he may want from us. The group was split up and we
          were all working on something different for the project. So the
          following was created by Melany and I, then reviewed by the whole
          group.

            >Empathy Map</a
          >

          <h3>Survey Results</h3>

          We created a survey to gather some user data and get a better
          understanding of who will be using the final project and their
          preferences. We conducted an initial survey to first gather some basic
          data. Then we conducted a second to clarify some more questions we
          had. For the second interview I came up with some questions.

          <h3>User Scenario</h3>

          We used chat gpt to come up with a user scenario based on our
          research, specifically our survey results for our persona. We then
          re-enacted our user scenario. I was behind the camera but the main
          person handling the camera was Tim amd Luc
          <br /><br /><br />

          <h3>Interview Transcripts</h3>

          For this project we conducted a multitude of interviews. We conducted
          2 client interviews with Erion to gain data on what Erion wants from
          our group and what he expects from the website. We also conducted 3
          usability testing interview fo gain feedback on our prototype. This
          was done by Rob and I. The first client interview was conducted by
          Zhan and I transcribed it.

          <h3>A/B Testing</h3>

          A/B testing was conducted so we can finalize between certain
          choices.This was to figure out what the users prefer in certain
          elements. We conducted this with 10 individual as you can find find
          both the figma used as well as the results to the testing.

          <h3>Research</h3>

          The following is all the research we have done as a group. Where we
          have compiled all our research and what we have done with our
          research. From the interview and survey we created a mood board,
          empathy map and persona. For this we had a misunderstanding and
          completed it last minute but we all split the work and got it it done.
          Because I transcribed the interview I had to summarize the interview
          we had with Erion for this this document.
          <br /><br /><br />

          <h3>Final prototype</h3>

          This was the final figma prototype we came up with after we got feed
          back from Erion on the individual prototypes we showed him. We did
          however receive feedback that showing individual prototypes were messy
          and confusing so we know not to do that in the future.

          <h3>Final Report</h3>

          This was the final report we created. This contains all the
          information about the project from the problem to the solution we came
          up with as well as future recommendations. For my personal
          contribution on this report itself I worked on the summary, the
          glossary, chapter 1: introduction, chapter 2: about the client and
          chapter 3: assignment overview. Documentation is something that I am
          quite familiar with so i was able to play on my skills by working on
          this.

          <h3>Final Website</h3>

          For this aspect I did not to anything as this was handled by Rob,
          Yvonne and Tim. We decided that they were the strongest in this aspect
          so they worked on this.

          <h3>Personal contribution</h3>

          Here you can find a summary of my personal contributions to the
          project. This team charter was initially create by Melany and I to
          outline the group norms, values and roles. Some specific things that
          was done my me in the project plan include: the project definition and
          background, the risk assessment along side Tim, the project structure
          and the CMD research methods and linking it to the corresponding
          sub-question. So the empathy may was created by Melany and I, then
          reviewed by the whole group. For the second interview I came up with
          some questions. The first client interview was conducted by Zhan and I
          transcribed it. I conducted the usability testing interviews with Rob.
          Because I transcribed the interview I had to summarize the interview
          we had with Erion for the research document. For final report I worked
          on the summary, the glossary, chapter 1: introduction, chapter 2:
          about the client and chapter 3: assignment overview.

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe i achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Design</h3>

          For this project we have to design a website for our client. So far we
          have to some design choices from Erion that we have to consider in
          this project.

          <h3>Research</h3>

          Research is constantly being done for in the project. The group had to
          use many research methods to gain relevant information. To understand
          what users and the client want research has to be done. Especially
          researching there research methods of CMD and the design thinking
          process.

          <h3>Communication</h3>

          Communication is constantly being gone between our client as well as
          within the group. Communicate with the group is also important to also
          have a good flow within the group. Communication is important in all
          aspects of media design, from understanding what clients want to
          communicating your ideas.

          <h3>Professional Identity</h3>

          I believe that i have come far especially from where I have started.
          While I am definitely not where I want to be I will to continue to
          grow by try and asking for feedback to improve and learn.

          <h3>End Thoughts</h3>

          As we come to a close this project has been fun. I truly appreciate
          the group I have been working with. They were always open minded to
          ideas. The were ready to help even if it was not in regards to the
          project. Most of us were easily able to communicate with each other.
          And we know how to have fun as well as work.
