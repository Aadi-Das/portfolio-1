          <h2>Assignments</h2>
          In media production, we learned how our design choices impact the
          effect how our users view what we put out. From text that we use to
          the "minor" positioning of certain elements. We had to bring something
          that has colors that we liked and from this we had our first
          assignment. Our first assignment was to create a logo and a brand
          behind it. I did not end up using the colors because i did not think
          in worked with what i wanted to achieve This is something i came up
          with. Im am still not satisfied with it so i will continue to work on
          it.

          <a class="linkbutton" href="pdf/Asset 3.pdf">Logo</a>
          <br /><br /><br />

          I made many iterations and am still not satisfied. I wanted to show a
          sense of luxury with my brand. I wanted to give off a logo that you
          would see on a branded purse. I think that is the kind of look i want
          to have.

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe i achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Design</h3>

          In this class we had to create a logo and so there have been many
          iterations. I initially used figma initially then adobe. To have good
          design it is important to have many iterations.
