        Hi. Welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Aadira Das and I am 20
        years old. I was born in India, raised in the Caribbean,St. Maarten, and
        have a dutch passport. Currently, I am a student at Fontys in the media
        profile. I have my high school degree in St.Maarten. I then did the
        International Bachelorette program and obtained the degree(Thank god!).
        Now I am here. Other than my prior education I have done taekwondo and
        have red belt. I am looking to continue or take up a new martial art at
        the moment. I also enjoy reading, mostly fiction, my favorite genre
        being thriller/mystery.
        <br />
        <br />
        This portfolio contain all the work that i have done in semester two for
        all my classes. While going through this portfolio you will come across
        the following: UCD, Media Production, Programming and Project. Each page
        will contain the work I have done for each class, the struggles I faced
        and how I improved them or plan to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within each class you can find which learning outcomes I believe I
        achieved and why. Click on read more if you want to know what the
        learning outcomes are.

      <span id="more">
        <h4>Interactive media</h4>
        <p>
          You create prototypes of interactive media products for your client by
          using iterations, user research and examples from the professional
          field. Prototypes of interactive media: simple user interaction with
          standard prototyping techniques. Users need minimal instruction to use
          products or do tests. Techniques vary from low-fidelity paper
          prototyping and sketching to high-fidelity tooling with Adobe XD (or
          similar). Examples are interfaces (with or without visual and audio
          support), web apps, online games, dashboards. Iterations: the ongoing
          process of product improvement in small successive steps. User
          research: research into the needs, wishes and behavior of end users by
          doing desk research and interviews and gathering feedback by
          conducting user tests. Examples from the professional field:
          successful, popular, commonly used or referenced media products.
        </p>
        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>
          You program and integrate proofs of concepts based on validated
          requirements and documented with version control tools. Proofs of
          concepts (pocs): programming small pocs to focus on basic skills.
          Integrating various smaller pocs into a larger application. The focus
          is a fundamental understanding of JavaScript. Validated requirements:
          to be determined by the bachelor student by doing research (end users,
          stakeholders). For the AD students: given in advance in the
          instructions of exercises and assignments. Version control tools: a
          tool (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) to monitor your progress and backup your
          work (push, pull, commit).
        </p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          You craft quality visual designs with a professional toolset
          professional toolset: apply industry standard tools, for instance
          Adobe Creative Cloud or an alternative set of similar applications.
          Visual designs: layout and look and feel of media products, like
          posters, banners, animations (2D/3D), AR/VR, video productions,
          websites, apps. Quality: recognized by the public, professionals and
          experts as skillfully crafted.
        </p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>
          You apply exploratory research methods, driven by a curious and
          critical attitude. Exploratory research: research aimed to gain
          familiarity with a phenomenon, to gain experience and to acquire new,
          significant personal insights into a given situation. Exploratory
          research is flexible and can address research questions of all types:
          what, why and how. Methods: use and apply methods from the DOT
          framework and the CMD methods pack. Curious and critical attitude: you
          have the ability to be amazed and you are open to wonder. You like to
          try out new things, you want to access new knowledge and you feel the
          urge to gain an understanding of your findings. You do not take facts
          or results for granted, but you verify your insights by checking
          multiple sources and engaging in dialogue with peers and experts.
        </p>
        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>
          You communicate effectively with your stakeholders (text and visuals)
          about the progress of your project and the motivation of your choices.
          Effective communication: you keep people informed online or
          face-to-face about your activities in order to limit
          misunderstandings, clarify objectives and improve productivity. You
          tailor your communication based on your audience's needs and current
          knowledge. You respect the interests of you audience (e.g. keeping
          time). Stakeholders: all people involved in your project or the use of
          your product.
        </p>
        <h4>Professional identity</h4>
        <p>
          You present your professional identity as a media designer in a
          portfolio that shows your growth and choices. Professional identity:
          an overview of your past experiences, your current view on yourself
          and a statement of what kind of professional you would like to become.
          Portfolio: a well-designed and interactive personal development report
          that contains authentic and recent work, reflections, (peer-)feedback
          and self-assessments Growth: your individual progress this semester.
