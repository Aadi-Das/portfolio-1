          <h2>Assignments</h2>
          Videography is the last assignment to conclude this year and semester.
          I felt two ways about this assignment. We first came up with ideas, we
          ended up using Fleur's idea of creating a documentary of her dog.
          Melany and I each created a storyboard. Melany then created a high
          version fidelity of her story board. The recording part, I really
          enjoyed though i may have not gotten the best shots it was quite fun
          to try. Then the editing aspect was ome thing that I found especially
          tough. I will say that this was because of a lack of experiences using
          editing apps. Melany and I worked on editing this together with Melany
          compiling all the clips, I added transitions. I used the ken burn
          effect on the initial photos after we got feedback and Melany added
          more. I did the voiceover. Which Melany edited into the video. Fleur
          created the transcription and subtitles that we placed into the final
          video. Vanessa added breaks to the interview however her file could
          not be rendered so Melany and I redid them, but we used her idea of
          where clips could be added.Fleur was our actor and of course the main
          star, her dog, Timon. Towards the end, when i finally got the hang of
          using Davinchi I will say i enjoyed it more. I am happy with the end
          product considering no one in our group knew anything about
          videography and editing.

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

          These are the following learning outcomes that I believe i achieved in
          this class:

          <h3>Design</h3>

          I mean this whole project was designing one the recording was
          complete. We had make style choice base on the feel we wanted to give
          the audience we got feedback of on how some choices can be seen
