          <h5>Interactive media</h5>
          <p>You create prototypes of interactive media products for your client by using iterations, user research and examples from the professional field.
          Prototypes of interactive media: simple user interaction with standard prototyping techniques. Users need minimal instruction to use products or do tests. Techniques vary from low-fidelity paper prototyping and sketching to high-fidelity tooling with Adobe XD (or similar). Examples are interfaces (with or without visual and audio support), web apps, online games, dashboards.
          Iterations: the ongoing process of product improvement in small successive steps.
          User research: research into the needs, wishes and behavior of end users by doing desk research and interviews and gathering feedback by conducting user tests.
          Examples from the professional field: successful, popular, commonly used or referenced media products.</p>
          <h5>Development</h5> 
          You program and integrate proofs of concepts based on validated requirements and documented with version control tools.
          Proofs of concepts (pocs): programming small pocs to focus on basic skills. Integrating various smaller pocs into a larger application. The focus is a fundamental understanding of JavaScript.
          Validated requirements: to be determined by the bachelor student by doing research (end users, stakeholders). For the AD students: given in advance in the instructions of exercises and assignments.
          Version control tools: a tool (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) to monitor your progress and backup your work (push, pull, commit).
          <h5>Design</h5> 
          You craft quality visual designs with a professional toolset professional toolset: apply industry standard tools, for instance Adobe Creative Cloud or an alternative set of similar applications.
          Visual designs: layout and look and feel of media products, like posters, banners, animations (2D/3D), AR/VR, video productions, websites, apps.
          Quality: recognized by the public, professionals and experts as skillfully crafted.
          <h5>Research </h5>
          You apply exploratory research methods, driven by a curious and critical attitude.
          Exploratory research: research aimed to gain familiarity with a phenomenon, to gain experience and to acquire new, significant personal insights into a given situation. Exploratory research is flexible and can address research questions of all types: what, why and how.
          Methods: use and apply methods from the DOT framework and the CMD methods pack.
          Curious and critical attitude: you have the ability to be amazed and you are open to wonder. You like to try out new things, you want to access new knowledge and you feel the urge to gain an understanding of your findings. You do not take facts or results for granted, but you verify your insights by checking multiple sources and engaging in dialogue with peers and experts.
          <h5>Communication</h5> 
          You communicate effectively with your stakeholders (text and visuals) about the progress of your project and the motivation of your choices.
          Effective communication: you keep people informed online or face-to-face about your activities in order to limit misunderstandings, clarify objectives and improve productivity. You tailor your communication based on your audienceâ€™s needs and current knowledge. You respect the interests of you audience (e.g. keeping time).
          Stakeholders: all people involved in your project or the use of your product.
          <h5>Professional identity</h5>
          You present your professional identity as a media designer in a portfolio that shows your growth and choices.
          Professional identity: an overview of your past experiences, your current view on yourself and a statement of what kind of professional you would like to become.
          Portfolio: a well-designed and interactive personal development report that contains authentic and recent work, reflections, (peer-)feedback and self-assessments
          Growth: your individual progress this semester.

      <h4>Interactive media</h4>
      <p>
        This outcome is something that i am constantly working on. In media design 
        the whole point of creating is to have something that is user friendly and  
        interactive. This outcome was mostly physically achieved in out programming 
        classes where we would have recreate functioning website. The end goal of 
        the project as well is to have and interactive website. And in media production 
        we had to create a logo for which i had many prototypes to reach the final. 
      </p>

      <h4>Development</h4>
      <p>
        Having smaller goal to achieve the main one is something that i constantly do to 
        understand better. By doing this a am able to also feel a sense of achievement. I 
        also use git as a version control. but development is constant so i will keep trying to 
        improve. 
      </p>

      <h4>Design</h4>
      <p>
        What good design is, is subjective. but using the right tools is helpful. and in the case of 
        making the logo having many prototypes to have good design.
      </p>

      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>
        Research is constantly being done especially in the project where the group had to use many 
        research method. To understand users research has to be done to stand out in the make and to 
        understand your user needs and wants.
      </p>

      <h4>Communication</h4>
      <p>
        This outcome is constantly being achieved as we have to communicate with our client for the 
        project. We also have to communicate with the group to also have a good flow within the group. 
        Communication is important in all aspects of media design, from understanding what clients want 
        to communicating your ideas.
      </p>

      <h4>Professional identity</h4>
      <p>
        This is something that is a continuing goal. I don't think is something you achieve and done.
        Using javascript is something that i have never done but now i am working on that. i still need to improve
        on getting feedback because it is something i struggle with but i am improving.
